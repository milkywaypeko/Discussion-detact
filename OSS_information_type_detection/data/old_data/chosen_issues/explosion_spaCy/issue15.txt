I'll say a bit more about what's blocking this.\n\nThe lexemes.bin data file has been constructed in a way that depends on various intermediate data files --- for instance, I processed an unannotated corpus into a list of word counts, and then smoothed the counts with another script, and then consumed the smoothed probabilities with the current quick-and-dirty make_lexicon.py script, which isn't even in this repository yet. I also need to set up a program to generate Brown clusters, and configure word2vec to generate word vectors.\n\nFinally, I need to document the process, and document the tokenizer file formats, so that I can describe what you'll actually need to do to add new languages.\n\nInstead of doing these things, I've mostly been doing bug-fixes, improving the API docs, and trying to improve my deployment process, which at the moment feels very error-prone.\n\nI'll say a little bit about what will be required to add new languages.\n1. Select an unannotated corpus. This will probably be Wikipedia --- it's a nice way to streamline things across languages. Another nice solution would be to run a language identification program over Common Crawl dumps, so that we can get text from wider genres.\n2. Select an annotated corpus. This will define the tokenization standards that we have to target. I'll be licensing the data, so you probably won't have direct access to it --- I'll have to do the actual training. It will probably be nice to give you a web API, so you can run things. If the API you call is emailing me \"hey, train this model\", well...That sucks. \n3. Define tokenization rules. This is mostly a list of prefix tokenization, a list of suffix tokenization, and a list of special-cases, which are exact-matched. The \"How It Works\" page says a little bit more about this, but not enough.\n4. Write a lemmatizer and morphological analyser. If there's a WordNet for the language you're targeting, and it's any good, I would prefer to lemmatize to WordNet sense-keys. The BabelNet project is probably the useful way to go about this.\n\nHaving written all this, I'm thinking it might be nice to inter-operate closely with Gensim on this. Gensim will give us the word2vec implementation, and would be a good way to handle the boot-strapping problem: if getting spaCy to work on a new language initially depends on processing a bunch of unannotated data with spaCy, then things are awkward.\n\nI'll think more about this, and probably reach out to Radim about it.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/explosion/spaCy/issues/comments/100045349", "html_url": "https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/15#issuecomment-100045349", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/explosion/spaCy/issues/15", "id": 100045349, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDA0NTM0OQ==", "user": {"login": "geovedi", "id": 747879, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc0Nzg3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/747879?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi", "html_url": "https://github.com/geovedi", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geovedi/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2015-05-07T23:20:55Z", "updated_at": "2015-05-07T23:20:55Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "When I was still using redshift, I used word2vec and gensim to generate word cluster with `window_size=2`.
