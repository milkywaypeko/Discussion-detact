  "body": "I would like to propose an additional instance method to the ensemble estimators to fit additional sub-estimators. I kluged up an implementation for gradient boosting that appears to work through my limited testing. I was thinking the signature would be something like\n\n``` python\ndef fit_extend(self, X, y, n_estimators):\n```\n\nwhere `self.n_estimators += n_estimators` is updated as so. I don't think fit_extend is a particularly great name so I'd welcome other suggestions. Perhaps we would want to hash the features and labels when fit() is called so we can check that the same features and labels are provided to this function.\n\nIf people think this would be a useful addition I would be willing to put together a PR, it seems like it should be straightforward to implement and add tests/docs for.\n",

That was my motivation.\n\nI can understand being hesitant about adding another instance method. I thought it might be worthwhile to add another optional parameter to fit() but I saw this quote on the contributing page.\n\n> fit parameters should be restricted to directly data dependent variables\n\nSo I wasn't sure that would be a good idea. Would\n\n``` python\ndef fit(self, X, y, n_estimators=self.n_estimators)\n```\n\nbe acceptable? Then if `n_estimators > self.n_estimators`, we'll then train that many more estimators.\n\nI agree that adding in n_estimators parameter to the prediction method is nice, but I think you'll agree that it solves a different problem.

In order to do early stopping the user has to write some some code that basically repeatedly calls `fit_extends` and then checks the CV error. \n\nI'd rather propose the `monitor` fit parameter that we discussed in the past: `est.fit(X, y, monitor=some_callable)` where `some_callable` will be called after each iteration and is passed the complete state of the estimator. The callable could also return a value whether or not the training should proceed.\n\nUsing such an api one could implement not only early stopping but also custom reporting (e.g. interactive plotting the training vs. testing score) and snapshoting (all X iterations dump the estimator object and copy it to some location; this is great if you are running on EC2 spot instances or some other unreliable hardware ;-)\n\nEven with such a `monitor` API, however, I think there would be a need for an API to fit more estimators once the model has been fitted (i.e. `fit_extends`) - often one trains a model and does some introspection to find that its probably better to have run more iterations - existing estimators use the `warm_start` parameter to implement such a functionality (e.g. see `linear_model.ElasticNet`) - here is the docstring of the parameter::\n\n```\nwarm_start : bool, optional\nWhen set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.\n```\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer `fit_extends` (or `fit_more`) over `warm_start` - warm start is quite implicit - you have to::\n\n```\nest = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=1000)\nest.fit(X, y)\n\n# now we want to fit more estimators to ``est`` \n# if you forget warm_start=True you nuke your previous estimators - quite implicit\nest.fit(X, y, n_estimators=2000, warm_start=True)\n\n# alternatively - more explicit\nest.fit_more(X, y, n_estimators=1000)\n```\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/comments/12882423", "html_url": "https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585#issuecomment-12882423", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585", "id": 12882423, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODgyNDIz", "user": {"login": "GaelVaroquaux", "id": 208217, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwODIxNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/208217?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux", "html_url": "https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GaelVaroquaux/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2013-01-30T10:03:20Z", "updated_at": "2013-01-30T10:03:20Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "> # alternatively - more explicit\n> \n> est.fit_more(X, y, n_estimators=1000)\n\nTo me, fit_more corresponds really to the partial_fit that we have in\nother estimators.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/comments/12882709", "html_url": "https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585#issuecomment-12882709", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585", "id": 12882709, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODgyNzA5", "user": {"login": "amueller", "id": 449558, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU1OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/449558?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller", "html_url": "https://github.com/amueller", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2013-01-30T10:10:46Z", "updated_at": "2013-01-30T10:10:46Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "@pprett I think there should be an easy way to do easy things. a monitor api is very flexible but actually you want to do early stopping **every time** you use an estimator, right?

Consider the\nfollowing example:\n\n```\n# this is the intended use-case for warm_start is faster convergence\n\nclf = SGDClassifier(n_epochs=10)\nclf.fit(X, y)\n\nclf2 = clone(clf)\nclf3 = SGDClassifier(n_epochs=10)\n\nclf2.fit(X, y, warm_start=True)\nclf3.fit(X, y)\n\n# clf2 and clf3 should converge to the same solution - but since clf3\n```\n\ncan reuse the fitted weights from clf it might converge more quickly\n    # under the hood `SGDClassifier.fit` resets the \"training\" state mode\nthe estimator (adaptive learning rate for sgd)\n\n```\n# now partial fit\nclf = SGDClassifier(n_epochs=10)\nclf.partial_fit(X, y, classes)\n# training has not completed yet \"training\" state (adaptive learning rate) is stored.\n\nclf.partial_fit(X, y)  # resume with previous learning rate\n```\n\nDisclaimer: This example might be pedantic because the differences in terms\nof the learned weights is minimal - but conceptually they are IMHO totally\ndifferent things...\n\n>  \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585#issuecomment-12883146.\n\n## \n\nPeter Prettenhofer\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/comments/12884052", "html_url": "https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585#issuecomment-12884052", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585", "id": 12884052, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODg0MDUy", "user": {"login": "ogrisel", "id": 89061, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDYx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/89061?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel", "html_url": "https://github.com/ogrisel", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ogrisel/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2013-01-30T10:47:39Z", "updated_at": "2013-01-30T11:00:46Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "The `warm_start` API was initially introduced to allow faster computation of a series of identical linear models when using a path of regularizers `alpha`.

But as soon as it has, warm_starting will make it possible to compute the regularization path faster, exactly as for ElasticNet.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/comments/12942855", "html_url": "https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585#issuecomment-12942855", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585", "id": 12942855, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTQyODU1", "user": {"login": "amueller", "id": 449558, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU1OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/449558?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller", "html_url": "https://github.com/amueller", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2013-01-31T13:48:49Z", "updated_at": "2013-01-31T13:48:49Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "SGDClassifier does `n_iter` epochs of updates, then stops.

But it seems like you could split estimators into two classes: those that freeze parameters once they are fit (ensembles, DTs), and those that don't (linear models). By that I mean with warm_start you won't refit the first n sub-estimators of an ensemble or the existing splits in a decision tree. The lack of being able to reach anywhere in the parameter space with warm_start for ensembles and DTs makes me think that an instance method would be more appropriate.\n\nIf an instance method is chosen, does it need to be more general as @amueller noted? If at some point someone wanted the ability to increase the max_depth of the sub-estimators, that could also be handled with `fit_more()`?\n\nFor what it's worth, I would also be against defensive.

In a near future, I would like to implement generic meta-ensembles that could combine any kind of estimators together. What I rather see is a \"combination\" mechanism that would take as input a list of (fitted) estimators and would produce a meta-estimator combining them all. \n\nIn practice, I think we can achieve that without adding any new function to our API. For example, one could simply pass such a list of fitted estimators to the constructor of the meta-ensemble.\n\nIn terms of API, one could (roughly) implement such ensembles in the following way:\n\na) Bagging:\n- constructor: `base_estimator` (optional), `n_estimators` (>=0), a list `L` of fitted estimators (optional).\n- fit: extend `L` with `n_estimators` new instances of `base_estimators` fitted over (bootstrap copies of) the training samples. If no base estimator is given, then it is equivalent to combining the estimators in `L`.\n\nb) Stacking:\n- constructor: `base_estimator` (optional), `n_estimators` (>=0), a list `L` of fitted estimators (optional).\n- fit: extend `L` with `n_estimators` new instances of `base_estimators` fitted of bootstrap samples, then refit a model over the predictions of the estimators. \n\nc) Forest:\n- constructor: `base_estimator` (optional), `n_estimators` (>=0), a list `L` of fitted estimators or a forest (optional).\n- fit: extend `L` with `n_estimators` new instances of `base_estimators` fitted over the training samples. Here we could also check whether the estimators in `L` are forests or decision trees. Forests would be flattened in order to put all trees on the same level.\n\nAlso, in such a framework, computation of an ensemble could easily be distributed over several machines: build your estimators; pickle them; then recombine them into one single meta-estimator. One could even wrap that interface into a MapReduce cluster, without digging into our implementation at all!\n\nWhat do you think? I am aware this is only relevant to some kind of ensembles though. For instance, GBRT and AdaBoost are (in my opinion) more suited to either `warm_restart` or `partial_fit`. \n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/comments/13480530", "html_url": "https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585#issuecomment-13480530", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585", "id": 13480530, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDgwNTMw", "user": {"login": "glouppe", "id": 477771, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Nzc3MQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/477771?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe", "html_url": "https://github.com/glouppe", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glouppe/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2013-02-13T09:19:35Z", "updated_at": "2013-02-13T09:19:35Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "Just to be clear, to extend a forest, one would do something like:\n\n```\nforest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\nforest.fit()\nforest_extended = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, L=forest)\nforest_extended.fit() # now counts 200 trees\n```\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/comments/13482707", "html_url": "https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585#issuecomment-13482707", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1585", "id": 13482707, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDgyNzA3", "user": {"login": "amueller", "id": 449558, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTU1OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/449558?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller", "html_url": "https://github.com/amueller", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amueller/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2013-02-13T10:24:30Z", "updated_at": "2013-02-13T10:24:30Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "What is the motivation of that interface?
