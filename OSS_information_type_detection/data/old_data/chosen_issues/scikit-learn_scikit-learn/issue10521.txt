  "body": "Based on some discussions we are having here and issues that are opened, we are having some doubts that `CategoricalEncoder` (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9151) was the good choice of name (and since it is not released yet we have some room for change).\r\n\r\nSo summary of how it is now:\r\n\r\n- The class name `CategoricalEncoder` says what type of data it accepts (categorical data)\r\n- The keyword argument `encoding` specifies *how* to encode those data\r\n\r\nCurrently we already have `encoding='onehot'|'onehot-dense'|'ordinal'`.\r\n\r\nBut what to do in the following cases:\r\n\r\n- We want to add more encoding options (eg binary encoding, mean target encoding, unary encoding, ...). Do we keep adding those as new values for the `encoding` kwarg in the one big `CategoricalEncoder` class?\r\n- We want to add an option specific to one of the encodings (eg for 'onehot' encoding to drop the first (redundant) column, or for 'ordinal' encoding base the order of the categories on the frequency, ...). The problem here is that we then need to add additional keyword arguments to `CategoricalEncoder` that are or are not active depending on what you passed for `encoding` kwarg, which is not the nicest API design.\r\n\r\nFor that last problem, we already had this with the `sparse=True/False` option, which was only relevant for 'onehot' and not for 'ordinal', and which we solved with having both 'onehot' and 'onehot-dense' encoding options and not a `sparse` keyword. But such an approach also does not scale.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, there is a PR to add a `UnaryEncoder` (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/8652). There was a related discussion on the naming in that PR, as currently the name says *how* it encodes, not what type of data it gets (in the current design, it accepts already encoded integers, not actual categorical data. In that regard, to be consistent with CategoricalEncoder, it might better be named OrdinalEncoder because it needs ordinal data as input).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat are the options forward:\r\n\r\n1) Keep things as we have it now in master, and be be OK with adding some new options to the single class (an important question which is hard to answer now, is how much new features we will want to add in the future).\r\n2) Switch the naming scheme and have a bunch of 'categorical encoders' where the name says how it encodes (OnehotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, and later maybe BinaryEncoder, UnaryEncoder, ...)\r\n\r\nSo it is a bit a trade-off of potential build up of number of classes vs number of keyword arguments in a single class.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne problem with the second approach (and one of the reasons we went with `CategoricalEncoder` in the first place, even before we added the multiple encoding options), is that there is already a `OnehotEncoder`, which has a different API than the `CategoricalEncoder`. And, there is not really a good other name we could use for the encoder that does one-hot encoding. \r\nHowever, I think that, with some temporary ugly hacks, we could reuse the name, if we are OK with deprecating the current attributes (and I think we agree it are not the most useful attributes). The idea would be that if you fit the class with string data, you get the new behaviour, and if you fit the class with integer data, you get a deprecation warning indicating the default behaviour will change (and indicating which keyword to specify to get rid of the warning). \r\n\r\ncc @jnothman @amueller @GaelVaroquaux @rth ",

Suppose you have one feature with values [2, 3, 5, 2]. I thought the current OneHotEncoder would have categories [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (while current CategoricalEncoder would have categories [2, 3, 5]). But you are right that the `active_features_` is also only [2, 3, 5], essentially making them the same with the default value of `n_values='auto'`.\r\n\r\nSo it is only the case where you pass an integer to `n_values` (like `n_values=6` for categories=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in the above case) to specify the number of categories that will actually be an API change (deprecated / removed). \r\nAnd that will be easily be replacable by the user with `categories=range(6)`\r\n\r\nSorry for the confusion. \r\nIn that light, I think we even don't need the `legacy_mode` option. We can just translate `n_values=6` to `categories=range(6)` internally and raise a warning for that (but need to check this with the actual tests). \r\n\r\nThe other difference is the handling of unseen categories. With the current behaviour of the OneHotEncoder, if the unseen values are within the range(0, max), it will not raise an error even if `handle_unknow='error'` (the default). But also that can be solved separately by in such a case raising a warning that the user should set `handle_unknown='ignore'` manually to keep the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe only feature we would loose is the distinction between unknown categories that are within the range(0, max) (by the current OneHotEncoder not regarded as 'unknown') and those that are bigger than that (> max, those are currently already regarded as unknown by the OneHotEncoder).

If n_values is set explicitly, do we publish categories_? \r\n\r\nI personally would already as much as possible provide the attributes of the new interface, even in legacy mode. So in both case I would calculate `categories_` (even if it would be a bit more work)\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nSo I tried to put the above logic in code (will push some updates to the PR), and I have one more question for the case of integer data when `n_values` or `categories` is not set (typical case for 'legacy_mode'). The problem lies in the fact that if the inferred categories are simply a consecutive range (0, 1, 2, 3, ... max), there is no difference between the new and old (legacy) behaviour, and we don't necessarily need to raise a deprecation warning. \r\nSome possibilities to do in this specific case:\r\n\r\n1) Detect this case (that the inferred categories are a consecutive range), and in that case don't raise a warning.\r\n    - This is possible to detect (with a little bit of extra code complexity) as we are already in fit anyhow\r\n    - I *think* this will be a common case when using OneHotEncoder with integer data, and a case where the user actually does not need to worry about our refactoring, so it would be nice to not bother him/her with a warning\r\n2) Always raise a warning, and indicate in the warning message what to do if you are in such a case (in addition to an explanation what to do if you don't have a consecutive range):\r\n    - If they know they have only consecutive ranges as categories, they want to ignore the warning, so we can add to the warning message an explanation how to do this (add a code sample with filterwarnings they can copy paste)\r\n    - A potential advantage of this is that we can also add to the warning message that if they used the LabelEncoder to create the integers, they can now directly use OneHotEncoder (I think this currently is a typical usage pattern). That way, the warning will also go away\r\n3) Always raise a warning but provide a keyword to silence it (eg `legacy_mode=False`)\r\n    - If we find the advice to use a `filterwarnings` statement (see point 2 above) too cumbersome, we could also add a keyword to obtain the same result\r\n    - Disadvantage of this is introducing a keyword that will not be needed anymore in a few releases when the deprecations are cleaned up. \r\n\r\nI am personally in favor of option 1 or 2. Using the LabelEncoder before OneHotEncoder seems to be a typical pattern (from a quick github search), and in those case you *always* have consecutive ranges, and there will never be a change in behaviour with the new implementation, so we shouldn't warn for it. On the other hand, if we warn we can point them to the fact that *if* they used LabelEncoder, they no longer need to do it. Which would be nice to actually give this advice explicitly. \r\nThe question is how frequently users have such consecutive integers as categories without having used LabelEncoder as the previous step ..\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/comments/362324607", "html_url": "https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/10521#issuecomment-362324607", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/10521", "id": 362324607, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjMyNDYwNw==", "user": {"login": "jorisvandenbossche", "id": 1020496, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA0OTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1020496?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche", "html_url": "https://github.com/jorisvandenbossche", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jorisvandenbossche/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-02-01T16:39:45Z", "updated_at": "2018-02-01T16:40:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "Hmm, one case I forgot is when you have integer inferred categories that are *not* consecutive (let's say [1,3,5]), but you want the new behaviour and not legacy behaviour (so in that case you cannot just ignore the warning, as that would handle unseen values differently in the transform step, i.e. values in between the range (eg 2) will not raise an error). \r\nIn case we don't provide the `legacy_mode=False` keyword, the only way to obtain the new behaviour is by manually passing `categories=[1,3,5]`, which can be a slight inconvenience.

Do we keep the current `CategoricalEncoder`? If not, the idea is to split it in different classes, one class for each type of encoding (currently 'onehot' and 'ordinal' encoding).\r\n\r\n2. If we split in multiple classes, we could (ideally?) use OneHotEncoder for the 'onehot' encoding, but this class already exists. So, do we integrate the new 'onehot' encoding (which supports strings and has different parameters) in the existing OneHotEncoder class? Or do we choose another name? (eg DummyEncoder)\r\n\r\n3. If we choose to integrate into the existing OneHotEncoder, are we OK with the following consequences: we deprecate a bunch of the keywords/attributes of OneHotEncoder, and a specific usecase (automatically ignoring unseen values within the *range* of seen values) will not be possible anymore after deprecation period.\r\n\r\nMost of the discussion above was about question 3 (the complex details of how to integrate CategoricalEncoder(encoding='onehot') into OneHotEncoder).

"author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "In the `category_encoders` package, all encoders have a `cols` argument, similar to the `categorical_features` in the old OneHotEncoder (although it does not accept exactly the same kind of values). See eg http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/onehot.html \r\nSo that is related to the current discussion we are having in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/10523 about deprecating `categorical_features` or not. \r\n\r\nFor the rest I think there are not really  conflicting keywords (they have some others specific to dataframes which we won't add to sklearn at this point). The naming for OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder at least is consistent with the `category_encoders` package.\r\n"}]
