  "body": "[**TL;DR:** We're designing a new input pipeline API for TensorFlow, and we'd like to collect your feature requests on this issue.]\r\n\r\nWe've noticed that one of the biggest challenges in getting started with TensorFlow is how to load your own data into your programs. While TensorFlow has several methods that can be used to build complex input pipelines (such as [`tf.train.string_input_producer()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/string_input_producer), [`tf.train.batch()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/batch), etc.), they were designed for a particular use case (processing a static set of files repeatedly), and the average user experience with these methods is not great. For example:\r\n\r\n* Once you reach the end of a pipeline, it becomes closed and you can never use it again in the same session. This requires users to use unnatural workarounds&mdash;with control flow or multiple sessions&mdash;to get a signal after processing an entire epoch, or switch between processing two datasets (e.g. training and validation data) in the same program.\r\n  * See #2514 and #4535 for feature requests about handling multiple epochs.\r\n  * See #7902 and numerous Stack Overflow questions for examples of processing different datasets in the same program.\r\n* The current pipelines use TensorFlow queues and multiple Python threads, which can lead to poor performance (lock contention in the queues and the Python GIL) and hard-to-understand exceptions (`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError`).\r\n  * See #6845 for a discussion of input pipeline performance.\r\n  * See #7525 and [many more Stack Overflow questions](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Btensorflow%5D+outofrangeerror) for an example of the confusing error.\r\n* The pipelines behave poorly if you forget to call `tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess)`: in fact, they hang indefinitely and deadlock the user program.\r\n  * See #7945 and [many Stack Overflow questions](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Btensorflow%5D+hang) for some examples of users who have been bitten by this problem.\r\n\r\nWe're decided to start from a clean slate and redesign the input pipeline API. The existing methods will remain until TF 2.0 (at least), but we are planning to add a new set of methods for loading and manipulating datasets. We're still preparing a detailed design, which we plan to share soon, but we anticipate that there will be two new APIs:\r\n\r\n* A `Dataset` represents a collection of data elements. Each element  can be a tuple of one or more tensors (e.g. an image and its label). We will provide methods for creating datasets from tensors, and deriving them from another dataset (e.g. by slicing its elements, repeating its elements, shuffling its elements, batching its elements, mapping a function over its elements, etc.). \r\n* An `Iterator` can be created from a `Dataset`. An iterator represents the current position within a dataset, and exposes an operation (like `tf.QueueBase.dequeue()`) that can be run to get the next element. There will be explicit operations for initializing an iterator, so that it can be reused after you have processed all of the elements in a dataset.\r\n\r\nA similar pattern turns up in many different settings, including [Java's Stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html), [Scala's collections](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/overview.html) (and hence Spark's RDDs), and [.NET's Language Integrated Query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx).\r\n\r\nWe're announcing this plan early because we want to collect feedback on what features you&mdash;as TensorFlow users&mdash;would like to see in an input pipeline API. What other pain points have we missed? What features do you miss from other systems? What other suggestions do you have?\r\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you!",

Which and how many samples are generated differs per epoch (potentially conditional on past training behavior). Actually, we don't even use the nomenclature of an epoch anymore, since the same data is never seen twice, and above mentioned generation/sampling goes beyond the usual data augmentation.\r\n\r\nLong story short: With a slightly out-of-the-ordinary use case, we've been hit by pretty much all of the problems you have mentioned above, and our workarounds have not been pretty. We'd be extremely happy to see a very flexible mechanism, where such cases are supported, and data generation doesn't have to be shoehorned into forced-upon concepts like epochs, finitely repeating queues, etc. (although they can be modeled by its primitives).\r\nI am not sure how well the planned Dataset/Iterator API would support this.\r\n\r\nEdit: Things we still need of course, include multi-threaded data generation, and multi-threaded random shuffle producer-consumer queues. But without the bane of GIL -- maybe via easy C++/Eigen hooks and thread control on the native side?

I'd like to understand more about your use case, though. How frequently do you move from one outer \"data set\" to the next? Are there any specific operations that you perform at the end of a \"data set\" or can your training loop handle the concatenation of records from different \"data sets\"?\r\n\r\nWe're planning to have a few nested iteration primitives, so that you can write a function mapping an element (e.g. a string representing your outer \"data set\") to a `Dataset` (representing the records in that \"data set\") and then flattening them down to a single `Dataset`.

Now I can stop writing my own (horrible) dataset class. Many of the things said already resonate with my experience.\r\n\r\nTo the extent possible, I would like to code dataset-independent tensorflow computations. I don't want to have 3 different gan classes: each with their own create graph and fit methods, simply because one dataset doesn't fit in memory, the other is an np.array, and the other is generated on the fly.\r\n\r\nThe use case that affects me the most is [do n times: train for k iter/epoch, validate model, repeat]. There are clear problems with queues like you said. A minor issue for which I offer no solution is that while the scheduling(how long to train for before validate) is done perhaps by some method of a model class that I would like to be dataset-independent, whether it makes sense to talk in terms of iter or epoch is determined by the dataset--ruining some of the independence.\r\n\r\nSome other ideas I jotted down while brainstorming my own class:\r\n- The dataset class (and not the model) should probably the one to have batch_size passed to it. It's awkward to ask for batch_size as a parameter during fitting and during dataset/queue creation, and ideally the compute graph doesn't have batch_size baked in.\r\n- A \"verbose\" dataset class should keep track of it's own statistics. It should maintain its own counters(tensors) that keep track of iterations, samples, and epochs.

Then a solution I really like to see, is to be able to receive(similar to dequeue) tensors from a different process. (Like #4836)\r\nThe benefits are:\r\n1. Can use whatever tools/languages to produce data from any sources, as long as they're finally sent with certain message protocol.\r\n2.

The input pipeline is definitely the\r\nsteepest part of the learning curve.\r\n\r\nI'd like:\r\n* A unified API to manage both in-memory (`feed_dict`) dataset and large one so that the same code scale and your model only have to talk to one API. Although, I have not use it yet, I liked what I read in the input pipeline documentation.\r\n* More iterators! They are great. Asynchronous iterators would be even better (see [PEP492](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/)). Iterators implementing `__len__` are great for progress report.\r\n* multiprocessing rather than threading\r\n* Please no `Dataset` class because, IMHO, the \"dataset\" concept is ill-defined. The `Dataset` class described in the original post already exists in Python: it is a list of tuples. And what is a \"dataset\", anyway? A collection of train/valid/test data or simply a collection of data? Is it just a file? directory? generator? Are each data item (input/target) couple? Is that always true? Is the dictionary part of the text dataset?\r\nThe choice of the data container is driven by a lot of constrains depending on its size and the execution environment. Instead of a `Dataset` container, I would prefer to have a rich set of containers offering different trade-off with respect to memory/time complexity. In addition, I would like to have a rich set of iterators, splitters, loaders, dumpers, slicers, repeaters, servers, generators to actually work with data coming from various source.\r\n* The epoch concept does not have a clear semantic either. In my experience, it is best defined by `epoch = global_step / steps_per_epoch` and `steps_per_epoch = dataset_size / batch_size`.\r\n\r\nHere my attempt to translate to small in-memory dataset some of the routines available in the TF's input pipeline for large dataset.

The one I'm currently struggling with is the integration of `tf.train.batch` with the ability of picking the source from which the input should come, for having train/val data in the same symbolic variable. #8168 \r\n\r\n  I understand these functions were initially thought for simple use cases, but it would be nice to have more control of the pipeline without the burden of managing _everything_ (e.g. using `tf.QueueBase.from_list` but being forced to feed queues and manage threads kind of manually).\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure if TensorFlow optimizes the dequeue operation under the hood but, if not, I think we could greatly benefit from a parallel dequeue operation that charges data (i.e. next batch) into the GPU memory while it processes the previous data (i.e. current batch).\r\n\r\n- I think `feed_dict`-like solutions are not optimal for passing big chunks of data to the train function, like a batch of images, since they're basically a pause in the execution graph to force TF to interact with _python's runtime_. An in-graph solution sounds better, with pointers to guide the graph execution, like `feed_dict={is_training = True}` to indicate the input should come from the training pipeline, the model should set batchnorm and dropout (et al) to train mode etc. This way, TF could better optimize/parallelize the execution, and all solutions would scale.\r\n\r\n- The standard functions for creating batches apparently do not provide an index to indicate which batch we are processing.

Hence, they should be only loosely coupled.\r\n\r\nSo the ideal input pipeline (everything without backprop) should be quite simple and slim: It should consist of a queue operation which receives data (list of tensors) from **some** source (sockets). #8728 is a good step in this direction with the pros:\r\n- you can use any library for preprocessing (opencv, nltk, ...)\r\n- prefetching is totally parallel and can be done at any/multiple machine\r\n- the sender-code can be put into any place -- even directly in game-engines or render-engines\r\n- data generation can be done in any programming language (without custom ops)\r\n\r\nI am not sure, if you really need something else and I do not understand why you really need `tf.image.random_*` *in* the graph.\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/comments/296703625", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-296703625", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951", "id": 296703625, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjcwMzYyNQ==", "user": {"login": "taion", "id": 3112159, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTIxNTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3112159?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion", "html_url": "https://github.com/taion", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/taion/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-04-24T15:20:50Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-24T15:20:50Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "I don't think the proposal here is to get rid of queues entirely, is it?\r\n\r\nDataset-style abstractions are pretty common in this space, and they're quite useful.

I want to perform inference by running my prediction\n> operation; but because the input queue runners etc are part of the graph\n> before that; I am stuck with that mechanism for performing inference.\n>\n> See issue here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43708616/tensorflow-\n> inference\n>\n> I like the tf record and queue runner thing now that I'm used to it; the\n> issue is the tight binding to the graph....\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-298442742>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAATxXYK7comPG84UqyKek2mbzhnifD4ks5r1lSWgaJpZM4MO9tN>\n> .\n>\n\n\n\n-- \n - Alex\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/comments/300480951", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-300480951", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951", "id": 300480951, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDQ4MDk1MQ==", "user": {"login": "mirosval", "id": 1315417, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTU0MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1315417?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval", "html_url": "https://github.com/mirosval", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mirosval/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-05-10T13:25:52Z", "updated_at": "2017-05-10T13:25:52Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Currently I am worried that my training/prediction preprocessing will diverge over time.\r\n\r\nI would be interested in a pipeline where:\r\n\r\n* Preprocessing and post processing can be serialized with the inference in a single model and then used from another language (no `tf.py_func`, but able to provide implementation at runtime)\r\n* There is a clearer distinction between input shapes, for training you usually want batches, but for prediction you often care only about single examples\r\n\r\nThe preprocessing and post processing do not require backprop, but they sill need to carry some values with them (normalization divisors or one hot mappings).

I'd like to understand your use case a little better. Do you imagine that most uses will combine exactly two datasets (and hence we might use method chaining to combine them, e.g. `ds1.chain(ds2)`, `ds1.product(ds2)`) or will it be more common to combine more datasets (and hence we'd take a similar approach to `Dataset.zip()`, e.g. `Dataset.chain([ds1, ds2])`, `Dataset.product([ds1, ds2])`)? Also note that, if you need `product()` in the short term, I think you can write `ds1.flat_map(lambda x: tf.contrib.data.Dataset.zip((tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_tensors(x).repeat(), ds2)))`. You could also fake out `chain()` with `Dataset.flat_map()` and `tf.cond()` but that would be quite ugly :).\r\n\r\n* @snnn: Thanks for kicking the tires! It's great to hear that the new API brought a speedup for your code... we've definitely favored flexibility over performance with the initial version of the API, but look out for improvements over the coming versions.\r\n\r\n   The idea of supporting seekable file formats is very appealing, and we're figuring out a good API for that. Right now you can use `Dataset.skip()` and `Dataset.take()` to select a sub-dataset from the files, but it is not very efficient, because they materialize the skipped-over inputs before discarding them. I could imagine adding an `Iterator::Seek(size_t n)` method internally, which would allow iterators to specialize their behavior in this case (or fall back to using `GetNext()` in a loop). This also seems like it would be important for checkpointing iterators, which might be useful for fault tolerance.\r\n\r\n* @omoindrot: I agree that the `try-except` construction is pretty ugly, and we should try to find ways to improve it. The current version is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the queues, which use `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` to signal completion, and various other classes are designed to catch that exception. Exposing an `iterator.is_empty` property would be possible, but it would be tricky to make it work in the way you suggest, because (to avoid an exception being raised) you'd need to guard the training subgraph with a `tf.cond(iterator.is_empty, make_train_op, lambda: tf.no_op())`. Another possibility would be to change the Python API for iterators to use two ops: `Iterator.move_next()` and `Iterator.get_current()` (e.g. like the C++ `IEnumerator` protocol), but that would introduce an additional `sess.run()` call, and make it harder to share the iterator between threads.\r\n\r\n   One possibility I've considered is to create a wrapper that turns an `Iterator`-consuming step into a Python iterator. e.g. Some straw-man code:\r\n\r\n   ```python\r\n   def iterate_step(sess, fetches):\r\n     cached_step = sess.make_callable(fetches)\r\n     try:\r\n       while True:\r\n         yield cached_step.run()\r\n     except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:\r\n       pass\r\n\r\n   # ...\r\n   for _, step, loss in iterate_step(sess, [train_op, global_step, loss]):\r\n     if step % 100 == 0:\r\n       # Run periodic eval, e.g.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n* @jimfleming and @vonclites: Thanks for looking into the `MonitoredSession` integration. It's great to hear that it \"just works\"! I think we'll still need to do something better for the more advanced cases where we might want to reinitialize an iterator in the same session.\r\n\r\n* @ahundt: From our initial experiments, the *peak* performance of the benchmark input pipeline is still slightly higher than what you get from using the `tf.contrib.data` API. However, the peak performance is much higher than the throughput of actually using the data to train a model like Inception or ResNet, so you might not notice the difference in regular use. We're investigating how to close the gap, and it's very likely that we'll incorporate some of the ideas from the benchmark code into the `Dataset` implementation.\r\n\r\n   In particular, one current limitation of the `Dataset` and `Iterator` implementation is that the entire pipeline runs on a single device, whereas the more explicit code in the benchmarks is able to split the processing across multiple CPU and GPU devices. For the best performance, it's going to be important to integrate optimizations like the `StagingArea` for prefetching data to the GPU before it is needed, and we're working on a way to do that more transparently. For now, you can manually pipeline the output of an `Iterator.get_next()` op with the `StagingArea.put()` op in a similar manner to the benchmark code."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/comments/303602263", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-303602263", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951", "id": 303602263, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzYwMjI2Mw==", "user": {"login": "jasonkriss", "id": 1836763, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3NjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1836763?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss", "html_url": "https://github.com/jasonkriss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-05-24T02:43:05Z", "updated_at": "2017-05-24T02:43:05Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "This is fantastic!

"author_association": "NONE", "body": "I am only starting to read into the new API, but I want to share two problems that I had with the old Input Queues in concurrence with using MonitoredSession with SessionRunHooks. \r\nWe also used two separate queues, one handling input data_files as string names and the other one the resulting input data with preprocessing being done in between those two. \r\nWe needed to make sure that the enqueue operations fills at least a certain multiple of the batch size into the first queue for our code to run without problems (otherwise the second input queue stalled)\r\nLooking something like this \r\n```\r\nqueue_size_train = sess.run([ipc.train.rsq_pre_size)\r\n            while queue_size_train <= batch_size * 5:\r\n                sess.run([ipc.train.rsq_pre_enq],\r\n                         feed_dict={ipc.train.ph_in: dataset.train.inputs,\r\n                                    ipc.train.ph_tgt: dataset.train.targets})\r\n                queue_size_train = sess.run([ipc.train.rsq_pre_size])[0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when I switched from a normal Session to using MonitoredSession and added a logging hook and told it to log the 'accuracy' tensor, it tried in vain to evaluate the first session run call as the hook had added that tensor to the fetch list, but with the queue being still empty there was no way to evaluate accuracy yet. \r\nProblematic was that the program just stopped and waited for some process to begin filling the queue, but there was non, so it just did nothing, but also didn't throw an exception or give any kind of warning, which made understanding what was happening a bit difficult. \r\nThe problem was eventually easily solved just executing one enqueue operation as the very first sess.run() call within the `with MonitoredSession(...) as sess:` block, but it would be nice if e.g. the input queues could be pre-filled with some initial values upon creation, so that this issue doesn't arise. \r\n\r\nAside from that, we use two different input pipelines for training and validation data that we connect to the network part of our graph alternating through a switch implemented through `tf.QueueBase.from_list`.\r\nNow in the `with ... as sess:` block you can easily implement an if block which pipeline to choose based on `global_step % interval == 0` but that means copy pasting the same code (sess.run() and add_summary() calls) times the number of different input pipelines you use (e.g. train, validation_1, validation_2, ...) \r\nIt would be nice to integrate this directly into MonitoredSession using Hooks somehow (i.e. every 10th step create and save summaries using validation_1 input pipeline, every 25th step ...)"}, {"url":

Also switching between e.g. training and validation dataset within one session works quite effortless. \r\n\r\nBut I have also some questions and suggestions.\r\nMaybe first a question: Is the `Dataset` class implemented based on queues? Because from the post here it doesn't get clear to me if or if not. In Tensorboard there is no additional information added with the new API about the status of any queue (how many objects are currently queued). Also observing my CPU/GPU resources/workload I can see, that the GPU workload drops to zero often (I guess in between batches). \r\n\r\nThen a suggestion:\r\nI think the `dataset.shuffle()` could be improved, if shuffling is not done only on the _n_ ( = buffer_size) samples in memory, but somehow on the whole list of inputs. For example: I'm storing path to images and labels in a text file. If shuffling is not done already in the text file you can often have thousands of lines after each other of the same class. If I now only work with `dataset.shuffle()` it can easily happen (depending of the buffer_size) that all elements that get shuffled are anyhow of the same class. The only. Maybe some toy example (ignoring labels and only working with image paths) to make my point clearer. For reasons of readability I work with a very small `buffer_size` and list of file names. But I guess everyone can imagine the same just with thousands of filenames in the list and a buffer_size e.g. of 5000.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\nimage_paths = tf.constant(['train/class1/img1.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img2.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img3.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img4.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img5.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img6.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img7.png',\r\n                          'train/class2/img1.png', \r\n                          'train/class2/img2.png',\r\n                          'train/class2/img3.png',\r\n                          'train/class2/img4.png',\r\n                          'train/class2/img5.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img6.png',\r\n                          'train/class1/img7.png'])\r\n\r\ndataset = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(image_paths)\r\ndataset = dataset.shuffle(3)\r\niterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()\r\nnext_element = iterator.get_next()\r\n\r\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\r\n    while True:\r\n        try:\r\n            path = sess.run(next_element)\r\n            print(path)\r\n        except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:\r\n            break\r\n```\r\nThis would print something like:\r\n```\r\n'train/class1/img1.png'\r\n'train/class1/img2.png'\r\n'train/class1/img4.png'\r\n'train/class1/img3.png'\r\n'train/class1/img5.png'\r\n'train/class1/img7.png'\r\n'train/class2/img1.png'\r\n'train/class1/img6.png'\r\n'train/class2/img3.png'\r\n'train/class2/img4.png'\r\n'train/class1/img6.png'\r\n'train/class2/img5.png'\r\n'train/class1/img7.png'\r\n'train/class2/img2.png'\r\n```\r\nSo since there is only a shuffling between the 3 examples in the buffer, the first samples (same for batches) will all have samples only of one class. So unless the shuffling isn't done already in the list of filenames you'll have troubles training any network. And if the available dataset of images is huge, increasing the buffer_size is often not a solution.\r\nAnother problem I see, is that like shuffling currently is implemented, there is no true shuffling of the entire dataset possible. The only workaround I found was pre-shuffling the filelist I read from the text file before creating the dataset. But once the dataset is created, it's only possible to shuffle in the range of the buffer_size."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/comments/305768735", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-305768735", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951", "id": 305768735, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTc2ODczNQ==", "user": {"login": "kmhofmann", "id": 7887138, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODcxMzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7887138?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann", "html_url": "https://github.com/kmhofmann", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmhofmann/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-06-02T12:10:51Z", "updated_at": "2017-06-02T12:10:51Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "@mrry  Thanks for the a preview of the new API; I think this is a good starting point!\r\nOne function that still seems to be missing, but would be essential for one of our primary use cases (see comment above: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-283186552) is a\r\n\r\n`Dataset.map_to_multiple()`\r\nused as in\r\n`dataset2 = dataset1.map_to_multiple(func)`\r\n\r\nfunction, where one element of `dataset1` is mapped to one **or more** elements for `dataset2`; i.e. #`dataset2` >= #`dataset1`.\r\nAs far as I understand it, `Dataset.map()` preserves a 1:1 mapping, which is not sufficient for our use case.\r\n\r\nOne concrete example of why this would be useful:\r\nAssume `dataset1` is a list of large images (e.g. 8192x8192 each) [with corresponding labels].

How does one do that?\r\n\r\n```\r\ntraining_dataset = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.range(100)\r\nvalidation_dataset = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.range(900,950)\r\niterator = tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_structure(training_dataset.output_types,\r\n                                   training_dataset.output_shapes)\r\nnext_element = iterator.get_next()\r\n\r\ntraining_init_op = iterator.make_initializer(training_dataset)\r\nvalidation_init_op = iterator.make_initializer(validation_dataset)\r\n\r\n# Run 3 epochs with 10 steps each\r\nfor e in range(3):\r\n  print(\"Epoch: %d\" %e)\r\n  for step in range(11):\r\n    sess.run(training_init_op)\r\n    ne = sess.run(next_element)\r\n    print(\"Step: %d Training set: next_element: %d \" %(step, ne))\r\n    # Run validation every 5 steps only\r\n    if step % 5 == 0:\r\n      sess.run(validation_init_op)\r\n      ne = sess.run(next_element)\r\n      print(\"Step: %d Validation set: next_element: %d \" %(step, ne))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above, since we run an init each time to get an iterator pointing to its required dataset, we end up running a training and validation on the first item of each dataset, always. How does one modify this to get the updated position of the iterator in each dataset?"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/comments/307491283", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-307491283", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951", "id": 307491283, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzQ5MTI4Mw==", "user": {"login": "jasonkriss", "id": 1836763, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3NjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1836763?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss", "html_url": "https://github.com/jasonkriss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonkriss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-06-09T20:26:24Z", "updated_at": "2017-06-09T20:26:24Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "@nirmalthacker Every time you run an iterator init op, it restarts the iterator.

However, I have a couple main concerns:\r\n- I cannot see a way currently to \"unzip\" a dataset. Let's say we have a trainable model that has both a `train`/`fit` method and a `infer`/`predict` method. Let's call the type of the (potentially) nested structure of inputs to our model `I` and the type of training inputs, which are only needed when training (e.g., supervision labels), `TI`. In this case, we want the `train` method to accept datasets with elements of type `(I, TI)` (i.e., a tuple of `I` and `TI`) and the `predict` method to accept datasets with elements of type `I` or `(I, TI)` (in which case it would ignore the labels). We also want the model to only have one underlying graph, supporting all these types of input. The way I could see doing that was for the underlying model to construct two iterators (one with elements type `I` and one with type `TI`) and initialize them according to the provided datasets. However, if somebody provides a dataset with elements of type `(I, TI)` to the `train` method, there is no way to unzip this dataset and initialize both iterators. One has to use `Dataset.map` twice, which is not efficient (I think but please correct me if I'm wrong) and which may also not pull matching elements from the datasets (if each pull advances the current index in the original first dataset -- I'm not sure if that happens).\r\n- It would be nice to support iterators over tensors defined in other languages as @sirfz mentioned. I cannot see an efficient way to do that with the current API. Please correct me if I'm wrong but currently one would have to create a new `TensorDataset` per batch and re-initialize an existing iterator.\r\nI think @fchollet may be able to comment on my first point as currently my understanding is that they are thinking or creating an entirely new graph for training only, for such cases (third step described [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/7503)).\r\n\r\nAlso, if my description is terribly unclear, please let me know and I'll try to clarify."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/comments/321976369", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-321976369", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951", "id": 321976369, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTk3NjM2OQ==", "user": {"login": "tillahoffmann", "id": 966348, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjM0OA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/966348?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann", "html_url": "https://github.com/tillahoffmann", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tillahoffmann/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-08-12T11:50:12Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-12T11:50:12Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "The new input pipelines are great! But unfortunately, we are unable to use them for large-scale training because our data preprocessing is quite costly and needs to be distributed across multiple machines--or we just haven't figured out the right way to do it. \r\n\r\nWe have thus been using the old `FIFOQueue` interface in the following manner (pseudocode):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Set up queues\r\nkwargs = {'capacity': ..., 'dtypes': ..., 'names': ..., 'shapes': ...}\r\ntrain_queue = tf.FIFOQueue(**kwargs)\r\nvalid_queue = tf.FIFOQueue(**kwargs)\r\nqueue_index = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)\r\nqueue = tf.QueueBase.from_list(queue_index, [train_queue, valid_queue])\r\nbatch_size = ...\r\nbatch = queue.dequeue_many(batch_size)\r\n\r\n# Build model\r\noutput = build_model(batch['X'])\r\nloss = evaluate_loss(output, batch['y'])\r\n\r\n# Fill queues\r\ntrain_data_stream = some_iterable_for_training_data()\r\nvalidation_data_stream = some_iterable_for_training_data()\r\nstart_filling_queues_in_background_thread(train_queue, train_data_stream)\r\nstart_filling_queues_in_background_thread(validation_queue, validation_data_stream)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving two different queues with `from_list` allows us to switch between the training and validation queue by either setting the `queue_index` or feeding it in the `feed_dict`.\r\n\r\nThe `some_interable_for_xxx_data` are usually generators that get data from a bunch of workers sitting behind a load balancer (e.g. using ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, or PubSub). This approach works well (because the queues provide a buffer) but we don't have any way of telling when the iterator is exhausted. Some workarounds are\r\n\r\n* closing the queue in the background thread such that a `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` is raised when the queue is exhausted (but then we can't reopen it again #4535)\r\n* setting a timeout on the `session.run` of the training op and assuming that a timeout is due to the queue being exhausted (but the network connection might be down or our workers might be too slow)\r\n* counting the number of items we've processed and comparing with the expected number of items in the iterator (but that's fiddly and sometimes we don't even know how long the iterator is)\r\n* adding an `exhausted` field to the queue `names` and letting the background thread enqueue an item with `exhausted=True` together with an assertion around the dequeue operation (but using `dequeue_many` will dequeue elements from the next epoch if the number of items per epoch is not an integer multiple of the batch size, see also #2514)\r\n\r\nNone of these are satisfactory and it would be great to see either the ability to construct `Dataset`s from python iterator *with a queue for buffering* or fix #4535 (which will automatically fix #2514).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hear whether we've just not been using the datasets API right."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/comments/322407451", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-322407451", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951", "id": 322407451, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjQwNzQ1MQ==", "user": {"login": "rasmusbergpalm", "id": 206013, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjAxMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/206013?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm", "html_url": "https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rasmusbergpalm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-08-15T08:17:39Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-15T08:17:39Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "I think the queues are nice enough.

Please feel free to open a new issue about any specific topics of feature requests related to `tf.contrib.data` and we can continue the discussion there.\r\n\r\nIn response to a few recent questions:\r\n\r\n* @GPhilo ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-325698349)) and @kratzert ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-308845375)): The Dataset API includes methods for prefetching, so it shouldn't be necessary to add a queue here, and you can retain the other advantages of Datasets (like reinitialization etc.). Passing `output_buffer_size=100 * FLAGS.batch_size` to the `dataset.map()` call, and following that with `dataset.batch(FLAGS.batch_size)` will run your `preprocess_image` function in parallel and should decently increase the performance.\r\n\r\n  ```python\r\n  dataset = tf.contrib.data.Dataset.list_files('{}/*/*.jpg'.format(FLAGS.dataset_dir))\r\n  dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_image, num_threads=FLAGS.num_threads,\r\n                        output_buffer_size=100*FLAGS.batch_size)\r\n  dataset = datsaet.batch(FLAGS.batch_size)\r\n  iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()\r\n  filenames, images = iterator.get_next()\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Note that in TF 1.4 there will be a `Dataset.prefetch()` method that makes it easier to add prefetching at any point in the pipeline, not just after a `map()`. (You can try it by downloading the current nightly build.)\r\n\r\n  In reponse to @kratzert's [specific question](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-308845375) about the implementation, the `Dataset` and `Iterator` classes don't use TensorFlow's previous producer/consumer queues (such as `tf.FIFOQueue` or `tf.RandomShuffleQueue`), but they do include simpler (and more efficient) implementations of the core ideas. For example, `Dataset.prefetch()` will start a background thread to populate a ordered buffer that *acts like* a `tf.FIFOQueue`, so that downstream pipeline stages need not block. However, the [`prefetch()` implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d236d19f7753ae23f91d794701efa70ace1629da/tensorflow/core/kernels/prefetch_dataset_op.cc) is much simpler, because it doesn't need to support as many different concurrent operations as a `tf.FIFOQueue`.\r\n\r\n* @vvekic ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-325357396)): I'd be curious to see your code before and after trying the Dataset API, and perhaps you could follow up by opening an issue describing the performance bottleneck. Compared to feeding or a (non-`StagingArea`) queue-based pipeline, the new API should be more efficient, and I'd be curious to know which parts aren't! \r\n\r\n  At present, you're correct that the `StagingArea` functionality is not included in the Dataset API, and for peak performance in GPU workloads you will need to add a staging area manually. However, we are actively working on implementing Datasets that can span devices (see 19a55725af8102d72d4e081c5139f0e4bd5a4bb7 for some of the work in progress) and one of the first use cases for that is to support prefetching into GPU memory.\r\n\r\n* @tengerye ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-323665406)): For dynamically feeding data into a Dataset, I'd suggest you try out the `Dataset.from_generator()` method that we're adding to TF 1.4 (and which is available in nightly builds already). I answered @albertz's Stack Overflow question about doing this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45928467/3574081). (Supporting distributed pipelines will depend on the cross-device Dataset support that I mentioned in the last answer, and we'll be implementing that soon.) I think this will also work for @rasmusbergpalm's [request](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-322407451), because you can create concurrent generators, and for @tillahoffmann's [request](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-321976369) and @sirfz's [request](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-321091444) as well. This API is very new though, so if you have any feedback, please let us know!\r\n\r\n* @jasonkriss ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-303602263)) We've implemented something called \"feedable\" iterators, which let you switch the input for single graph between multiple iterators (e.g. one for training and one for testing). The programmers' guide has [more details](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets#creating_an_iterator) about how to use this feature.\r\n\r\n* @guillaumekln ([link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951#issuecomment-308789560)) If you want to batch sequences with different lengths, you can use the `Dataset.group_by_window()` transformation. Have a look at [how this is used in the NMT model code](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt/blob/04c8c04a8b4e805f3d0a9c42b4d17c85f1324c55/nmt/utils/iterator_utils.py#L194) for an example.\r\n\r\nThanks again to all of you for your continued interest in this part of TensorFlow!"}]
